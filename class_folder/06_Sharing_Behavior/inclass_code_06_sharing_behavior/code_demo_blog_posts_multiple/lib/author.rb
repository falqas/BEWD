# Next, we have a class that has already been created for us called `Author`.
# This class models the attributes and methods that an author of a post would
# typically have. You will need to create getters and setters for the following
# three attributes: first_name, last_name and email.
class Author


  # Once the class is defined, create a method called `full_name` which uses
  # string interpolation to join together the first_name and last_name and
  # returns the Author's full name.
