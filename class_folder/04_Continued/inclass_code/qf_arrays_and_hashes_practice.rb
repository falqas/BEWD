# Question 1
# For an array, if you want to reverse the order, you can use array.reverse, but
# for this question, reverse an array without using reverse
# (the result should be ["This", "array", "is", "backwards", "."])
# 
# 
example_array = [".", "backwards", "is", "array", "This"]

# Question 2
# Iterate through first_names and last_name and populate result with the an array of hashes, 
# that has keys full_name, first_name, last_name
# (the result should be 
# [{full_name: "Kim Kardashian", first_name: "Kim", last_name: "Kardashian"}, 
#  {full_name: "Khloe Kardashian", first_name: "Khloe", last_name: "Kardashian"}, 
#  {full_name: "Kourtney Kardashian", first_name: "Kourtney", last_name: "Kardashian"}] 
# after the iteration).
the_kardashians = []
first_names = ["Kim", "Khloe", "Kourtney"]
last_name = "Kardashian"

# Question 3
# data_structures = ["arrays", "hashes", "variables"]
# Iterate over the sports Array and print out the following list 
# (with numbers and line breaks):
# "0. arrays"
# "1. hashes"
# "2. variables"
data_structures = ["arrays", "hashes", "variables"]
